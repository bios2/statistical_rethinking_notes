# homework

# 1. Suppose the globe tossing data (Chapter 2) had turned out to be 4 water and 
#    11 land. Construct the posterior distribution, using grid approximation. 
#    Use the same flat prior as in the book.


# 2. Now suppose the data are 4 water and 2 land. Compute the posterior again, 
#    but this time use a prior that is zero below p = 0.5 and a constant above 
#    p = 0.5. This corresponds to prior information that a majority of the 
#    Earthâ€™s surface is water.


# 3. For the posterior distribution from 2, compute 89% percentile and HPDI 
#    intervals. Compare the widths of these intervals. 
#    Which is wider? Why? 
#    If you had only the information in the interval, what might you 
#    misunderstand about the shape of the posterior distribution?


# 4. OPTIONAL CHALLENGE. 
#    Suppose there is bias in sampling so that Land is more likely than Water
#    to be recorded. Specifically, assume that 1-in-5 (20%) of samples are
#    accidentally recorded as "Water" instead as "Land". 
#    First, write a generative simulation of this sampling process.
#    Assuming the true proportion of Water is 0.70, what proportion does your 
#    simulation tend to produce instead?
#    Second, using a simulated sample of 20 tosses, compute the unbiased 
#    posterior distribution of the true proportion of water.
