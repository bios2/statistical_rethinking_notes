# homework

# 1. Suppose the globe tossing data (Chapter 2) had turned out to be 4 water and 
#    11 land. Construct the posterior distribution, using grid approximation. 
#    Use the same flat prior as in the book.


# values p is gonna take
p_grid <- seq.int(0,1,len=1000)
# prior
prob_p <- rep(1L,1000L)
prob_p <- dbeta(p_grid, 3L,1L)
# likelihood
prob_data <- dbinom(4, 15, prob = p_grid)
posterior <- proportions(prob_data * prob_p)

plot(prob_data)
plot(p_grid, posterior)

w <- rbinom(1e4, size = 9, prob = samples)
summary(as.factor(w)) # number of samples that are water (not land)
rethinking::simplehist(w)

# 2. Now suppose the data are 4 water and 2 land. Compute the posterior again, 
#    but this time use a prior that is zero below p = 0.5 and a constant above 
#    p = 0.5. This corresponds to prior information that a majority of the 
#    Earthâ€™s surface is water.

# values p is gonna take
p_grid <- seq.int(0,1,len=1000)
# prior
prob_p <- rep(1L,1000L)
prob_p <- rep(c(0L, 1L), each=500)
# likelihood
prob_data <- dbinom(4, 11, prob = p_grid)
posterior <- proportions(prob_data * prob_p)

w <- rbinom(1e4, size = 9, prob = samples)
summary(as.factor(w)) # number of samples that are water (not land)
rethinking::simplehist(w)

# 3. For the posterior distribution from 2, compute 89% percentile and HPDI 
#    intervals. Compare the widths of these intervals. 
#    Which is wider? Why? 
#    If you had only the information in the interval, what might you 
#    misunderstand about the shape of the posterior distribution?
s2 <- sample(p_grid, 1e4, prob = posterior, replace = T)

# 4. OPTIONAL CHALLENGE. 
#    Suppose there is bias in sampling so that Land is more likely than Water
#    to be recorded. Specifically, assume that 1-in-5 (20%) of samples are
#    accidentally recorded as "Land" instead as "Water". 
#    First, write a generative simulation of this sampling process.
N <- 1e4
# so, we are recording this as if water is 70% of earth
W <- rbinom(N, size=20, prob = .7)
# then, we account for the fact that water is undersampled (by 20%)
W_under <- rbinom(N, size=W, prob = .8)

#    Assuming the true proportion of Water is 0.70, what proportion does your 
#    simulation tend to produce instead?
hist(W_under/20)
mean(W_under/20)

# or if water is oversampled
W_over <- rbinom(N, size=20, prob = .7)
W_over <- rbinom(N, size=W, prob = .7 * 1.2)
hist(W_over/20)
mean(W_over/20)

#    Second, using a simulated sample of 20 tosses, compute the unbiased 
#    posterior distribution of the true proportion of water.

# list all the possitivilites that are possible in the world
p_grid <- seq.int(0,1,len=1000)
# prior
prob_p <- rep(c(0,1),each=500)
plot(p_grid,prob_p)

# likelihood
# so to 
prob_data <- dbinom(W, 20, prob = p_grid*.8)
plot(prob_data)
posterior <- proportions(prob_data * prob_p)
plot(p_grid, posterior)
